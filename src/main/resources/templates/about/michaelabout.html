<details><summary>Question 1</summary>
==========

<p>SHOW ALL YOUR WORK. REMEMBER THAT PROGRAM SEGMENTS ARE TO BE WRITTEN IN JAVA.</p>
<p>Assume that the classes listed in the Java Quick Reference have been imported where appropriate. Unless otherwise noted in the question, assume that parameters in method calls are not null and that methods are called only when their preconditions are satisfied. In writing solutions for each question, you may use any of the accessible methods that are listed in classes defined in that question. Writing significant amounts of code that can be replaced by a call to one of these methods will not receive full credit.</p>
<p>Consider the following class.</p>
<pre><code>public class LightSequence

    {

    // attributes not shown


    /** The parameter seq is the initial sequence used for

    * the light display

    */

    public LightSequence(String seq)

    /* implementation not shown */ }



    /** Inserts the string segment in the current sequence,

    * starting at the index ind. Returns the new sequence.

    */

    public String insertSegment(String segment, int ind)

    { /* implementation not shown */ }



    /** Updates the sequence to the value in seq

    */

    public void changeSequence(String seq)

    { /* implementation not shown */ }



    /** Uses the current sequence to turn the light on and off

    * for the show

    */

    public void display()

    { /* implementation not shown */ }

}

<p>Write the code segment below.</p>

<p>If oldSeq is &quot;1100000111&quot; and segment is &quot;11&quot;, then &quot;00000111&quot; should be stored in newSeq. If oldSeq is &quot;0000011&quot; and segment is &quot;11&quot;, then &quot;00000&quot; should be stored in newSeq. If oldSeq is &quot;1100000111&quot; and segment is &quot;00&quot;, then &quot;11000111&quot; should be stored in newSeq. Write the code segment below. Your code segment should meet all specifications and conform to the examples.</p>

<p>The straight-line distance between the two lights is given by the formula square root of the quantity a squared plus b squared.</p>
